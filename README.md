# Audio Emotion Analyzer with AI-based Therapeutic Responses

This project integrates emotion recognition from audio input with AI-driven therapeutic responses. It leverages speech emotion recognition (SER) models and advanced AI-based chatbots to provide empathetic, therapeutic-like interactions based on the user's emotions detected from their speech. This is designed to provide users with emotional insights and supportive responses, similar to a therapist's feedback.

## Project Overview

The system consists of two main components:
1. **Audio Emotion Recognition**: A backend service using machine learning models to detect the user's emotional state from audio input (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.).
2. **AI-driven Therapeutic Response**: Based on the detected emotion, the system interacts with an AI model trained to generate therapeutic, empathetic responses.

## Key Features

- **Emotion Recognition**: Uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to analyze emotions from spoken audio.
- **Therapeutic Responses**: Based on the recognized emotion, an AI chatbot provides empathetic responses to help users navigate their emotions.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Users can upload audio files, which are processed, and they receive a therapeutic response in real time.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **File Upload**: Multer (for handling file uploads)
- **Speech Emotion Recognition Models**: Hugging Face models like `wav2vec2` fine-tuned on emotion datasets
- **AI-based Therapy**: Fine-tuned AI models for generating therapeutic responses (e.g., Llama 2/3 models)
- **Audio Processing**: Python with Flask and libraries like `librosa` for audio feature extraction
- **Audio File Handling**: `soundfile`, `librosa`
- **Deployment**: Local development or deployable to cloud services for real-time processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** and **npm** (for the server)
2. **Python** and **Flask** (for the backend AI processing)
3. **Libraries**: 
    - For Node.js: `express`, `multer`, `node-fetch`, `form-data`
    - For Python: `flask`, `flask_cors`, `librosa`, `soundfile`, `numpy`

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
